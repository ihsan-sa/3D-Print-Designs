# 3D-Print-Designs

I enjoy creating functional models for 3D printing and posting them on the Bambulab Makerworld platform.
So far, my models have received over 3,500 downloads and $60 worth of boosts on the platform. 
While some designs are posted in the repository, all of them are available at [https://makerworld.com/en/@iiks](url). 
Most of the designs were created by me, while a few were made by my younger siblings, as I am teaching them to use Fusion 360 as well!

Some of my most successful designs include:
- A WD-40 3D printable straw designed in Fusion 360
- Customizable Boxes made with OpenSCAD
- A filament holder clip designed in Fusion 360
- Car vent cable and glasses holders
- Ethernet cable mount
